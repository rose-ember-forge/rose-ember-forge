<h1 align=center>👋🏽 Ahoy! Welcome to Raghu’s GitHub!</h1>

Hello! I’m **Raghunandan**, a researcher and data scientist with a background in **physics** and a strong interest in **artificial intelligence for healthcare**. My work lies at the intersection of neuroscience, machine learning, and interpretability — exploring how computational models can both emulate and elucidate biological intelligence.

## 🧩 Research & Academic Background

- 🎓 **Masters in AI for Health**, DSV, Stockholm University (in progress)  
  *Focus:* Deep learning for healthcare applications, model interpretability, and data ethics.

- 🧠 **Previous Research:** Neurophysics and computational neuroscience  
  *Goal:* To model biological neural networks using machine learning frameworks.

- **Publication:**`https://doi.org/10.1186/s40708-021-00141-5`

- ⚛️ **Foundation in Physics:** Strong analytical grounding and experience in data visualisation, problem-solving, and scientific computing.

I approach AI research with a physicist’s curiosity — seeking underlying principles and patterns — and with a commitment to building transparent, meaningful systems.
